<p> Many have been overdue 2-3 weeks due to lack of class funding. Sadly the union hall hasnt been able to ship any new sailors out due to the new fiscal year that is approaching mid-october, all licensed/unlicensed crew can attend the meeting which will be held Monday 28th of August.</p>
<h2> Delegation</h2>
<article>
<p>There has been new policies in place due to the dire need for reliefs also a new procedure filling out the HR123. Each member in the unlicensed crew must inform the Chief Mate/or Chief Engineer 60 days prior to sign off day. You must complete a full 120 sea days prior to sending your RPNFW to the coast guard, you cannot do 120 days and turn in paperwork it will be invalid and you will need an additional 60 days. Also, all meeting for new delegates will be posted on the board in the 02 lounge area each month due to continously crew change. If you have any concerns please speak up during meeting times, this is your chance to bring up any big issues within your everyday work days.</p>

<h3>New Contracts</h3>
<p>New Contracts will be in place January 2024, no vendor contractors are to be housed on the ship at all and must be responsible for their own meals. The AB on watch MUST make sure to check new visitor I.D as well as giving out the correct badges (yellow is a day pass, while red is weekly). Visitors must check in daily, they are to sign in and sign out and turn badge in. There have been issues getting them back please to sure to follow all steps due to the ship safety as well as your own being the first point of contact.</p>
<p>As stated in last week safety meeting, all crew MUST bring up any and all safety concerns to your department head immediately. DO not wait for the safety meeting, you can report any issues to the department head at any time, there is an open door policy without any consequence.</p>
